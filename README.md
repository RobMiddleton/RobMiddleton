## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rob Middleton and I work full time and father to 3 boys.
I am currently studying for a degree in Computing and IT with the Open University on a part time basis. At this point of my study, I am currently studying OOP with Java.
Aside from the Open University study, I am trying to learn how to use Vscode to write Java programs and also how Vscode and GitHub can interact with each other to help with my work flow.
